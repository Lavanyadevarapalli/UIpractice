                <p>Why is comprehensive view of Information Security critical to organizations?</p>
                <p>While reviewing the outsourced IT functions at a very large global engineering services corporate, information security was supposedly given due importance. To our utter surprise, it was found that all the admin level user info including passwords, IP addresses, and connection information were stored in an excel sheet. Even worse, the excel sheet was shared with many outsourced staff on laptops that were neither securely configured nor insured. The impact of the combined risks was then highlighted to the IT Top Management and corrective measures implemented forthwith.</p>

                    <p>SECURITY BEGINS AT THE TOP END</p>
                    <p>We had the opportunity to review the IT controls and Info sec functions at a large mining company. Different departments had implemented their own rules for various IT controls, including for length and complexity of passwords. There was no organization-wide standard defined. The first thing that was done was to raise the awareness in Top Management on the importance of laying down policies, and for following standards.</p>
